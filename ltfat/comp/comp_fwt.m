function c = comp_fwt(f,h,J,a,Lc,ext)
%COMP_FWT Compute DWT using FWT
%   Usage:  c=comp_fwt(f,h,J,a,Lc,ext);
%
%   Input parameters:
%         f     : Input data - L*W array.
%         h     : Analysis Wavelet filters - cell-array of length filtNo.
%         J     : Number of filterbank iterations.
%         a     : Subsampling factors - array of length filtNo. 
%         Lc    : Output subband lengths - array of length M = J*(filtNo-1)+1
%         ext   : 'per','zero','even','odd' Type of the forward transform boundary handling.
%
%   Output parameters:
%         c     : Cell array of length M. Each element is Lc(m)*W array.
