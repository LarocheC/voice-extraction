%DEMO_ISGRAM  Contruction of a signal with a given spectrogram
%
%   This demo demonstrates iterative reconstruction of a spectrogram.
%
%   Figure 1: Original spectrogram
%
%      This figure shows the target spectrogram
%
%   Figure 2: Linear reconstruction
%
%      This figure shows a spectrogram of a linear reconstruction of the
%      target spectrogram.
%
%   Figure 3: Iterative reconstruction using the Griffin-Lim method.
%
%      This figure shows a spectrogram of an iterative reconstruction of the
%      target spectrogram using the Griffin-Lim projection method.
%
%   Figure 4: Iterative reconstruction using the BFGS method
%
%      This figure shows a spectrogram of an iterative reconstruction of the
%      target spectrogram using the BFGS method.
