function L=filterbanklength(Ls,a);
%FILTERBANKLENGTH  Filterbank length from signal
%   Usage: L=filterbanklength(Ls,a);
%
%   FILTERBANKLENGTH(Ls,a) returns the length of a filterbank with
%   time shifts a, such that it is long enough to expand a signal of
%   length Ls.
%
%   If the filterbank length is longer than the signal length, the signal
%   will be zero-padded by FILTERBANK or UFILTERBANK.
%
%   If instead a set of coefficients are given, call FILTERBANKLENGTHCOEF.
%
