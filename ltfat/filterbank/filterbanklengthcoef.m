function L=filterbanklengthcoef(coef,a);
%FILTERBANKLENGTHCOEF  Filterbank length from coefficients
%   Usage: L=filterbanklengthcoef(coef,a);
%
%   FILTERBANKLENGTHCOEF(coef,a) returns the length of a filterbank with
%   time-shifts a, such that the filterbank is long enough to expand the
%   coefficients coef.
%
%   If instead a signal is given, call FILTERBANKLENGTH.
