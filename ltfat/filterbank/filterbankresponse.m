function gf=filterbankresponse(g,a,L,varargin)
%FILTERBANKRESPONSE  Response of filterbank as function of frequency
%   Usage:  gf=filterbankresponse(g,a,L);
%      
%   FILTERBANKRESPONSE(g,a,L) computes the total response in frequency of
%   a filterbank specified by g and a for a signal length of
%   L. This corresponds to summing up all channels. The output is a
%   usefull tool to investigate the behaviour of the windows, as peaks
%   indicate that a frequency is overrepresented in the filterbank, while
%   a dip indicates that it is not well represented.
%
%   In mathematical terms, this function computes the diagonal of the
%   Fourier transform of the frame operator when the filterbank is painless.
%
%   FILTERBANKRESPONSE(g,a,L,'real') does the same for a filterbank
%   intended for positive-only filterbank.
%
%   FILTERBANKRESPONSE(g,a,L,fs) specifies the sampling rate fs. This
%   is only used for plotting purposes.
%
%   FILTERBANKRESPONSE takes the following optional parameters:
%
%      'fs',fs    Sampling rate, used only for plotting.
%
%      'complex'  Assume that the filters cover the entire frequency
%                 range. This is the default.
%
%      'real'     Assume that the filters only cover the positive
%                 frequencies (and is intended to work with real-valued
%                 signals only).
%
%      'noplot'   Don't plot the response, just return it.
%
%      'plot'     Plot the response using PLOTFFTREAL.
