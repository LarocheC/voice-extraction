function [c,info] = fwt(f,w,J,varargin)
%FWT   Fast Wavelet Transform 
%   Usage:  c = fwt(f,w,J);
%           c = fwt(f,w,J,dim);
%           [c,info] = fwt(...);
%
%   Input parameters:
%         f     : Input data.
%         h     : Wavelet definition. 
%         J     : Number of filterbank iterations.
%         dim   : Dimension to along which to apply the transform.
%
%   Output parameters:
%         c      : Coefficient vector.
%         info   : Transform parameters struct.
%
%   c=FWT(f,h,J) returns wavelet coefficients c of the input signal f*
%   using J iterations of the basic wavelet filterbank defined by w*
%   i.e. the fast wavelet transform algorithm (Mallat's algorithm) is used.
%   In addition, the function returns struct. info containing transform
%   parameters. It can be conviniently used for the inverse transform 
%   IFWT e.g. fhat = iFWT(c,info). It is also required by the 
%   PLOTWAVELETS function.
%   
%   The coefficents c are the Discrete Wavelet transform (DWT) of the input
%   signal f, if w defines two-channel wavelet filterbank. The following
%   figure shows DWT with J=3.
%
%   The function can apply the Mallat's algorithm using basic filter banks
%   with any number of the channels. In such case, the transform have a 
%   different name. 
%
%   The basic analysis wavelet filterbank w can be passed in several 
%   formats. The formats are the same as for the FWTINIT function.
%
%   1) Cell array whose first element is the name of the function defining
%      the basic wavelet filters (wfilt_ prefix) and the other elements
%      are the parameters of the function. e.g. {'db',10} calls 
%      wfilt_db(10) internally.
%
%   2) Character string as concatenation of the name of the wavelet
%      filters defining function (as above) and the numeric parameters
%      delimited by ':' character, e.g. 'db10' has the same effect as above,
%      'spline4:4' calls wfilt_spline(4,4) internally.
%
%   3) Cell array of one dimensional numerical vectors directly defining
%      the wavelet filter impulse responses.  By default, outputs of the 
%      filters are subsampled by a factor equal to the number of the 
%      filters. One can pass additional key-value pair 'a',a (still inside
%      of the cell array) to define the custom subsampling factors, e.g.: 
%      {h1,h2,'a',[2,2]}.
%
%   4) The fourth option is to pass the structure obtained from the
%      FWTINIT function. The structure is checked whether it has a valid
%      format.
%   
%   If f is row/collumn vector, the subbands c are stored
%   in a single row/collumn in a consecutive order with respect to the 
%   inceasing central frequency of the corresponding effective filter 
%   frequency responses or equivalently with decreasing wavelet scale. The 
%   lengths of subbands are stored in info.Lc so the subbands can be easily
%   extracted using WAVPACK2CELL. Moreover, one can pass an additional
%   flag 'cell' to obtain the coefficient directly in a cell array. The
%   cell array can be again converted to a packed format using WAVCELL2PACK.
%
%   If the input f is a matrix, the transform is applied to each column 
%   if dim==1 (default) and [Ls, W]=size(f). If dim==2
%   the transform is applied to each row [W, Ls]=size(f).
%   The output is then a matrix and the input orientation is preserved in 
%   the orientation of the output coefficients. The dim paramerer has to
%   be passed to the WAVPACK2CELL and WAVCELL2PACK.
%
%   Boundary handling:
%   ------------------
%
%   FWT(f,w,J,'per') (default) uses the periodic extension which considers
%   the input signal as it was a one period of some infinite periodic signal
%   as is natural for transforms based on the FFT. The resulting wavelet
%   representation is non-expansive, that is if the input signal length is a
%   multiple of a J-th power of the subsampling factor and the filterbank
%   is critically subsampled, the total number of coefficients is equal to
%   the input signal length. The input signal is padded with zeros to the
%   next legal length L internally.
%   
%   The default periodic extension can result in "false" high wavelet
%   coefficients near the boundaries due to the possible discontinuity
%   introduced by the zero padding and periodic boundary treatment.
%
%   FWT(f,w,J,ext) with ext other than 'per' computes a slightly
%   redundant wavelet representation of the input signal f with the chosen
%   boundary extension ext. The redundancy (expansivity) of the
%   represenation is the price to pay for using general filterbank and
%   custom boundary treatment.  The extensions are done at each level of the
%   transform internally rather than doing the prior explicit padding.
%
%   The supported possibilities are:
%
%     'per'    Zero padding to the next legal length and periodic boundary
%              extension. This is the default.
%
%     'zero'   Zeros are considered outside of the signal (coefficient)
%              support. 
%
%     'even'   Even symmetric extension.
%
%     'odd'    Odd symmetric extension.
%
%   Note that the same flag has to be used in the call of the inverse transform
%   function IFWT if the info struct is not used.
%
%   Examples:
%   ---------
%   
%   A simple example of calling the FWT function:
% 
%     f = greasy;
%     J = 10;
%     [c,info] = fwt(f,'db8',J);
%     plotwavelets(c,info,44100,'dynrange',90);
