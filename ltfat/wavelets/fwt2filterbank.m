function [g,a] = fwt2filterbank( w, J)
%FWT2FILTERBANK  FWT equivalent non-iterated filterbank
%   Usage: [g,a] = fwt2filterbank(wtdef)
%
%   Input parameters:
%          w : Wavelet filters definition
%          J : Number of filterbank iterations.
%
%   Output parameters:
%         g   : Cell array containing filters
%         a   : Vector of sub-/upsampling factors
%
%   FWT2FILTERBANK( w, J) calculates the impulse responses g and the 
%   subsampling factors a of non-iterated filterbank, which is equivalent
%   to the wavelet filterbank tree described by w and J. The returned 
%   parameters can be used directly in FILTERBANK, UFILTERBANK.
%   
%   The filters are scaled if a is not returned. 
%
%   The function is wrapper for calling WFBT2FILTERBANK.
