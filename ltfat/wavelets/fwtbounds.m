function [AF,BF]=fwtbounds(w,J,L)
%FWTBOUNDS Frame bounds of DWT
%   Usage: fcond=fwtbounds(w,J,L);
%          [A,B]=fwtbounds(w,J,L);
%
%   FWTBOUNDS(w,a,L) calculates the ratio B/A of the frame bounds
%   of the filterbank specified by w and J for a system of length
%   L. The ratio is a measure of the stability of the system. 
%
%   [A,B]=FWTBOUNDS(w,J,L) returns the lower and upper frame bounds
%   explicitly. 
%
%   See FWT for explanation of parameters w and J.
%
%   See also: fwt, filterbankbounds
