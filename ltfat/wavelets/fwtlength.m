function L=fwtlength(Ls,w,J,varargin);
%FWTLENGTH  FWT length from signal
%   Usage: L=fwtlength(Ls,h,J);
%          L=fwtlength(Ls,h,J,...);
%
%   FWTLENGTH(Ls,h,J) returns the length of a Wavelet system that is long
%   enough to expand a signal of length Ls. Please see the help on
%   FWT for an explanation of the parameters h and J.
%
%   If the returned length is longer than the signal length, the signal
%   will be zero-padded by FWT to length L.
