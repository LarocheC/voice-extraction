function [c,info]=wfbt(f,wt,varargin)
%WFBT   Wavelet FilterBank Tree
%   Usage:  c=wfbt(f,wt);
%           [c,info]=wfbt(...);
%
%   Input parameters:
%         f     : Input data.
%         wt    : Wavelet Filterbank tree definition.
%
%   Output parameters:
%         c    : Coefficients stored in a cell-array.
%         info : Transform parameters struct.
%
%   c=WFBT(f,wt) returns coefficients c obtained by applying a wavelet 
%   filterbank tree defined by wt to the input data f. In addition, the
%   function returns struct. info containing transform parameters. It can
%   be conviniently used for the inverse transform IWFBT e.g. 
%   fhat = iWFBT(c,info). It is also required by the PLOTWAVELETS function.
%
%   wt defines a tree shaped filterbank structure build from the 
%   elementary two (or more) channel wavelet filters. The tree can have any
%   shape and thus provide a flexible frequency covering. The outputs of the
%   tree leaves are stored in c.
%
%   The wt parameter can have two formats:
%
%   1) Cell array containing 3 elements {w,J,treetype}, where w is
%      the basic wavelet filterbank definition as in FWT function, J*
%      stands for the depth of the tree and the flag treetype defines 
%      the type of the tree to be used. Supported options are:
%
%      'dwt'  
%        DWT tree. Just the low-pass output is decomposed further.
%
%      'full'
%        Full decomposition tree. Each output is decomposed up to level J.
%
%   2) Structure returned by the WFBTINIT function and possibly
%      modified by WFBTPUT and WFBTREMOVE.
%
%   If f is row/column vector, the coefficient vectors c{jj} are columns.
%   
%   If f is a matrix, the transformation is by default applied to each of
%   W columns [Ls, W]=size(f).
%
%   In addition, the following flag groups are supported:
%
%   'per','zero','odd','even'
%     Type of the boundary handling.
%
%   'freq','nat'
%     Frequency or natural ordering of the coefficient subbands. The direct
%     usage of the wavelet tree ('nat' option) does not produce coefficient
%     subbans ordered according to the frequency. To achieve that, some 
%     filter shuffling has to be done ('freq' option).  
%
%   Please see the help on FWT for a description of the boundary condition flags.
%
%   Examples:
%   ---------
%   
%   A simple example of calling the WFBT function using the "full decomposition" wavelet tree:
% 
%     f = gspi;
%     J = 7;
%     [c,info] = wfbt(f,{'sym10',J,'full'});
%     plotwavelets(c,info,44100,'dynrange',90);
