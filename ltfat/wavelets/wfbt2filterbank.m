function [g,a] = wfbt2filterbank( wtdef, varargin)
%WFBT2FILTERBANK  WFBT equivalent non-iterated filterbank
%   Usage: [g,a] = wfbt2filterbank(wtdef)
%
%   Input parameters:
%         wtdef : Wavelet filter tree definition
%
%   Output parameters:
%         g   : Cell array containing filters
%         a   : Vector of sub-/upsampling factors
%
%   wfbtmultid(wtdef) calculates the impulse responses g and the 
%   subsampling factors a of non-iterated filterbank, which is equivalent
%   to the wavelet filterbank tree described by wtdef. The returned 
%   parameters can be used directly in FILTERBANK, UFILTERBANK or 
%   FILTERBANK. 
%   
%   The filters are scaled if a is not returned. 
%
%   The function internally calls WFBTINIT and passes wtdef and all 
%   additional parameters to it.   
%   
%   Examples:
%   --------- 
%   
%   The following two examples create a multirate identity filterbank
%   using a tree of depth 3. In the first example, the filterbank is
%   identical to the DWT tree:
%
%     [g,a] = wfbt2filterbank({'db10',3,'dwt'});
%     
%
%   In the second example, the filterbank is identical to the full
%   wavelet tree:
%
%     [g,a] = wfbt2filterbank({'db10',3,'full'});
